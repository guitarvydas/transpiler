The job of `ohmjs.js` is to invoke the Ohm-JS tool from the command line.

We use `ohmjs.js` in the `Transpiler` component as a Leaf component.

`Ohmjs.js` accepts three command-line arguments (see the function `main`) and standard input plus one command line option.

`./ohmjs.js grammarName grammarFilename rwrwFilename [--trace] <text`

The command line arguments are:
1. the grammar name
2. the grammar filename
3. the rwr filename

*Aside: the `main()` function lists a 4th parameter `supportFileName`, but, that argument is obsolete and is present only due to historical reasons.  The argument should have been deleted, but, wasn't deleted, before this document was written.*

The source text to be parsed by Ohm-JS is supplied as a string on standard input.

The command line option is `--trace`. If this command line option is supplied, a trace of the semantic rules will be displayed on standard output, if possible.  Tracing code is automatically generated when the semantics are generated by the `rwr` tool. 

The results of the parse plus the semantics functions is written to standard output, like other command line tools.

## Future
We want to create an equivalent component that takes input from file descriptors (like `stdin` except mapped to other FDs like 3,4,5,...)
