This component rewrites source text arriving on its *input* port to its *output* port using a grammar filename and a rewrite specification filename, on ports *ohm* and *rwr* respectively.  

The port *grammar name* gets a string which names the grammar to be used.  This is a requirement of the OhmJS library.
