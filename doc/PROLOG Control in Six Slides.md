This transpiler converts Nils Holm's Scheme code into working JavaScript code.  

The goal of this transpiler is to create a searching and pattern-matching library for JavaScript.  The most convenient syntax for exhaustive searching is that of PROLOG (and, other Relational Languages).  Conveniently, Nils Holm has open-sourced the code for a PROLOG implementation in the language Scheme.  This transpiler converts Holm's code into working JavaScript code.  The emitted JavaScript code can be compiled and run by `node.js`.

Holm's original code can be found in [PROLOG Control In Six Slides](http://www.t3x.org/bits/prolog6.html)

The original code has been copied into this repository and lightly modified.
