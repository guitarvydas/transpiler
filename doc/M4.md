The `m4` Component sends it *input* text to a shell-out which runs the *m4* command (a full-featured Unix macro preprocessor) and collects *stdout* and *stderr* converting their data into Messages.

The *grammar* and *rewrite specifications* (.ohm and .rwr) are simplified by using `include` statements to enact inheritance. The basic grammars and rewrite details need to be used in every rewrite, but, the details can be elided and hidden from view, making the specifications easier to read and shorter. It is easier to write the specifications, when the niggly details don't get in the way and misdirect mental focus.
